This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

# Q4.2 load iris dataset
```{r}
iris_data = read.table(file.choose(),sep = "",header = TRUE,row.names = 1)
iris_mat = data.matrix(iris_data[,1:4])
```
# kmean and elbow curve
```{r}
loss = array(1:10)
for (i in 1:10)
{
  km_fit = kmeans(iris_mat,i)
  loss[i] = km_fit$totss
}


```
